 * We can deal a specific number of cards to specific number of players, 
 * display hands, and sort them. It also allows to control and validate that  
 * user input of cards and players is correct.

 * Parameters: Number or cards per players, number of players

 *        -1 if one of the conditions failed. 
 * Side Effects: None.

 * represents a card where its suit references an index of a constant 
 * array with such values and its face references the index of

 * Parameters: an array of structs (the empty deck)
 * Return: void
 * Side effects: This method modifies the array being passed to the
 * function by initializing the members of the structure
