 * Created on February 22, 2016, 6:51 PM
 * 
 * This program creates a deck of 52 cards using 4 suits
 * (Spade , Heart, Club , Diamond) and 13 faces (A, 2, 3,..10, J, Q, K)
 * After the deck is created and displayed it is shuffled and 
 * displayed again. At this point we are ready to deal the cards. 
 * The cards are dealt to the hands, then we sorted the hands and ranked them
 * After we ranked the hands we then determine the winner. 
 * The input to this program will be the 
 * number or cards per player and the number of players provided via
 * the prompt command line. This input will allow us distribute the 
 * specific number of cards to the specific players. 
 * A 2D array will be used to represent players and their cards. 
 *

/*---Pseudocode---
 * 1. Receive input from command line a validate
 * 2. Create a deck of cards (array of structs)
 * 3. Display deck
 * 4. Shuffle deck (using srand() and rand())
 * 5. Display deck after shuffle
 * 6. Create a 2D array where rows are hands and columns are
 * number of cards per player.
 * 7. Populate the 2D array (deal cards) and remove cards from deck 
 * at the same time.
 * 8. Display Hand.
 * 9. Verify the cards were removed from the deck by displaying deck
 * again (optional)
 * 10. Sort hands
 * 11. Displayed sorted hands
 * 12. Rank cards
 * 13.Display ranked cards
 * 14.Find winner *
