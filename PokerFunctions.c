 * This function is used to rank each hand. It has several auxiliar functions
 * to break the problem into smaller pieces. The possible rank are: 
 * Hight Card, One Pair, Two Pairs, 3 of a Kind, Straight, Flush, Full House,
 * Four of a Kind, and Straight Flush.
 * 
 * When it determines  the raking of a hand it calls function fillWinnerArray
 * which will store each player number, the rank, and the highest card for
 * the specify ranking. 
 * Parameters: number of hands, 2 struct arrays 
 * Return: void
 * Side effects: This method modifies the array being passed to the
 * function by initializing the members of the structure
